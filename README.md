# ISB_AMPBA_Capstone-Project_Deloitte-Anomlay-Detection-in-Business-Processes-using-Generative-AI

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for the ISB Capstone Project with Deloitte, focused on anomaly detection in business processes using generative AI. The goal of this project is to enhance fraud detection, streamline audit processes, and improve operational efficiency using generative AI.

## Project Overview
### Business Problem
Expense reimbursement fraud accounts for a significant portion of asset misappropriation cases, presenting challenges for timely detection and significant financial losses. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging generative AI to detect anomalies in transactional data, providing actionable insights for non-technical personnel.

### Benefits
- **Management**: Empowers management with actionable intelligence to mitigate risks proactively.
- **T&E Team**: Streamlines the process of reviewing and approving expenses, ensuring policy compliance.
- **Internal Auditors**: Enhances the audit process by effectively identifying potential fraud and policy deviations.

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow from data cleaning to the deployment of the anomaly detection model. Below is a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing empty columns and eliminating inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating detailed reports and visualizations.
3. **Data Transformation**: Merging relevant columns and preparing the data for modeling.
4. **Data Modeling**: Using KNN for anomaly detection and applying KRIs for rule-based modeling.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using classification metrics and comparing results with ground truth.
6. **Dashboard Requirements**: Gathering requirements and generating results/plots.
7. **Generative AI Implementation**: Utilizing LLM Agent/GenAI for insights and action plans.
